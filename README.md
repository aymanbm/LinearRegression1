# Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of cars using a Linear Regression model. The goal is to estimate vehicle prices based on various features using classical regression techniques and solid preprocessing strategies to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset (car data.csv) includes a mix of numerical and categorical features related to vehicle specifications, ownership, and seller information. Key preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Key Features
